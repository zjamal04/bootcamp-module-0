// This is a Swift playground, which is exactly what the name implies.
//
// Instead of actually making an app, you can just type code and play around
// with the language.
//

import Foundation

/* Printing is very easy to do in Swift
<-- Click the play button here */ print("Hello World")

// this might take a couple mins to compile because... Xcode is Xcode

// You should see the output in the console below.
// If you don't, click the little rectangular symbol in the bottom right corner.

// TODO: change this to your name
let name: String = "Noah"

// To print out variables, just enclose them with \()
print("Hi! My name is \(name).")
// ^^^ Try printing the statement above!
